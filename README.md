### A chat app built with NodeJS, Express and Socket.IO.

To be honest, I'm not expecting this to be anything special. There are millions of bad realtime chat apps out there already.
This is more for my own learning and understanding of WebSockets.

- There are comments inside `script.js` and `server.js` to help readers understand what on earth is going on but essentially, it's just a software-based game of ping-pong. Or bidirectional event emitting if you want to act smart.

- I plan to expand this project onto things like Firebase and might do a version with less abstraction (e.g. the `ws` module in `node`).

- ***Anyways, why are you here? Why am I writing this? Who will read this except for me? These are life's questions which I do not know the answer to.***

- Oh well, while you're here, you might as well read the source code.

- *I recommend starting at `server.js`, then heading down to `script.js` and `index.html`*

- Styling will come soon... Even though no one uses this app.

- To be honest, this `README.md` is this long because it looks good on GitHub.
